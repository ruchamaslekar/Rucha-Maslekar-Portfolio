Final Project Overview:
- I developed a personal portfolio website showcasing my professional journey, education, experience, and projects. 
- The website features dynamic content, powered by MongoDB for data management, and utilizes animation to enhance the user experience. 
- The website is built with a combination of technologies including HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB.

Challenges Faced:
- Integrating MongoDB with the project required careful planning and schema design, which was a bit challenging initially.
- Ensuring a consistent design across multiple pages while keeping the user interface engaging was also challenging.
- Managing animations and ensuring that they were synchronized with the content display took some trial and error.


Resources Used:
- Online documentation for Express.js
- MongoDB documentation for database setup and schema design.
- MDN Web Docs for HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript references.
- Stack Overflow for troubleshooting and community support.

Help Received:
- Refered class slides and course material.
